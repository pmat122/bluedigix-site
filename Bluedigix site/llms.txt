# Blue Digix

## About
Blue Digix is a revenue architecture firm for founder-led companies. We engineer the system between paid demand and predictable revenue. Founded by Paul Matarelli in New York City.

## What We Do
- Demand & Revenue Architecture: Design how paid demand, messaging, qualification, and sales engagement work together so interest converts into revenue predictably.
- Funnel & Conversion Systems: AI-powered pre-sell layers, qualification logic, and sequencing that reduce wasted conversations and increase close rates.
- Revenue Visibility & Frameworks: Clear performance signals that tell you what to scale, what to fix, and when to apply pressure.

## Who We Serve
Growth-stage, founder-led companies where paid demand is active but revenue doesn't scale with spend. Coaches, consultants, service businesses, and B2B companies with a sales team or founder-led sales process.

## Founder
